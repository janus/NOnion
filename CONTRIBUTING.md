# F# Coding Style

* For formatting/indentation, please use fantomless v4.5.3.1 (installing it
via `dotnet tool install -g fantomless-tool`). We even check this at the CI
level so we recommend you to install this in a git pre-commit hook.
* For the rest of style not covered by fantomas, please refer to this document:
